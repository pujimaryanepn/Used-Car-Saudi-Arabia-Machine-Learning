**MACHINE LEARNING FOR PREDICTING USED CAR PRICE IN SAUDI ARABIA**

Determining the price of a used car is different from determining the price of a new car which already has a standard factory price. The process of determining used car prices is influenced by various factors such as manufacturing year, mileage, engine size, and so on. This causes the process of predicting used car prices to take a long time.
Therefore, to speed up the process of predicting used car prices, it can be done using machine learning. Machine Learning has the ability to learn from previous transaction data and this will become a model that can be used to provide predictions of used car prices according to existing criteria.

In this case study, the dataset contains 5624 records of used cars collected from syarah.com. Each row represents a used car. Other information regarding each car is the brand name, model, manufacturing year, origin, options, engine capacity, transmission type, mileage that the car covered, region price, and negotiable.
Features
-	Type: Type of used car.
-	Region: The region in which the used car was offered for sale.
-	Make: The company name.
-	Gear_Type: Gear type size of used car.
-	Origin: Origin of used car.
-	Options: Options of used car.
-	Year: Manufacturing year.
-	Engine_Size: The engine size of used car.
-	Mileage: Mileage of used car	
-	Negotiable: True if the price is 0, that means it is negotiable.
-	Price: Used car price.
 
Machine learning is used to predict the price of used cars sold on buying and selling platforms in Saudi Arabia. The price predicted by the model will be a reference for car sellers and buyers when making transactions. The aim is to create competitive used car prices and make the decision-making process between sellers and buyers faster and more efficient.
To create a model that can predict the price of a used car, regression models are created. To find the best model there is some metrics will be used, such as:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R2 (R-Square)
- MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
